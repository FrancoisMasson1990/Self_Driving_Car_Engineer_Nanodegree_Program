# Self_Driving_Car_Engineer_Nanodegree_Program

The Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree program is an advanced program focusing on in-depth knowledge of autonomous systems. The program requires an application and is designed for those with moderate to high programming, technical, and/or quantitative skills.

## Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and Sensor Fusion

In this term, you'll first apply computer vision and deep learning to automotive problems. You will teach the car to detect lane lines, predict steering angles, and more, all based on just camera data. Next, you'll learn sensor fusion, which you'll use to filter data from an array of sensors in order to perceive the environment.

## Computer Vision

Use a combination of cameras and software to find lane lines on difficult roads and to track vehicles.

### Deep Learning
Deep learning has become the most important frontier in both machine learning and autonomous vehicle development. Experts from NVIDIA will teach you to build deep neural networks and train them with data from the real world and from the Udacity simulator. You’ll train convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs, and then train a neural network to drive a vehicle in the simulator!

### Sensor Fusion
Tracking objects over time is a major challenge for understanding the environment surrounding a vehicle. Sensor fusion engineers from Mercedes-Benz will show you how to program fundamental mathematical tools called Kalman filters. These filters predict and determine with certainty the location of other vehicles on the road. You’ll even learn to do this with difficult-to-follow objects by using an extended Kalman filter, an advanced technique.
